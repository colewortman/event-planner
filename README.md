## Event Planner

This web application allows users to create and delete their own events, as well as sign up or opt out of other user's events. An event consists of a title, a number of spots available, a date and time, and a location. Users will be able to search for events and sort them by date, as well as a profile page where they can view events they have signed up for.

Creating and organizing events can get needlessly complicated. Mass emails that may get lost or ignored, people signing up late or maybe the event is cancelled or rescheduled. The intended purpose of the application is to provide users with an easy way to organize and join events.
